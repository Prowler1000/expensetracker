A personal "website" to help keep track of expenses, intended to be hosted locally. While security is still important on trusted networks, it's not very high on my priority list right now.

Uses Prisma to access a database that stores expense data. Front-end uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). Prisma requires an environment variable that stores appropriate environment variable.

Code comments are currently non-existent. Once I *actually* get the first version ready for use, I intend on going through and making many comments.
